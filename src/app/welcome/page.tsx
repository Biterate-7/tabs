/**
 * The server-rendered landing page.
 *
 * `/` shows the same page to a first-time visitor, but it does so from inside
 * AppShell — which renders nothing until it has read localStorage, so that
 * route's HTML is empty until hydration. This route has no such dependency:
 * MarketingPage reads one environment variable and otherwise renders from
 * static data, so the whole page is in the server response with real metadata
 * attached. That makes this the URL worth sharing and the one worth indexing.
